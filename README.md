## Overview

This repository contains a data analysis project focused on analyzing the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of multiple countries and the world from the years 1960 to 2016. The project utilizes the `gdp_dataset.csv` dataset and Python libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, Seaborn, and Plotly for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project, `gdp_dataset.csv`, contains information about the GDP of various countries and the world from 1960 to 2016. It includes details such as country names, GDP values for each year, and other relevant information.

## Libraries Used

The following Python libraries were used for data analysis and visualization:

- NumPy: For numerical computations and array manipulation.
- Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
- Seaborn: For statistical data visualization.
- Plotly: For interactive and dynamic data visualization.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

- `gdp_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis process.
- `gdp_dataset.csv`: The dataset used for analysis.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions for usage.

## Analysis Steps

The analysis includes the following steps:

1. **Data Loading**: Importing the dataset using Pandas.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and any necessary preprocessing steps.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Understanding the dataset's structure, summary statistics, and distribution of variables.
4. **GDP Growth Analysis**: Visualizing the GDP growth over the years for the world and individual countries.
5. **Top 20 GDPs**: Grouping countries' GDPs to find the top 20 GDPs.
6. **Plotting with Plotly**: Using Plotly to create interactive graphs for the GDPs of countries and comparison graphs.
7. **Downloading Graphs**: Saving the graphs as HTML files for further analysis or sharing.

## How to Use

To run the analysis notebook:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries mentioned in the `requirements.txt` file.
3. Open `gdp_analysis.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to execute the cells and explore the dataset.
